## Problem Identified

The homepage "Best Selling Dab Rigs" featured $8,999 collector pieces as the first shopping experience. This signals "expensive store" before visitors see accessible $25-$150 products.

## What changed

The homepage now has two entry paths. Everyday visitors land on Value Dab Rigs and Everyday Essentials (affordable price range). Collectors who want the high-ticket heady glass have to go looking for it, which is the point.

The packaging strip now features the money categories: jars, PTFE/FEP, and parchment. Keyword-stuffed descriptions got rewritten into actual copy. WordPress shortcode remnants and the Rewind backup page got removed.

---

## What this should fix

Visitors now see $25-$150 products first instead of $8,999 collector pieces, which should reduce bounces from price shock. The keyword-stuffed descriptions were likely triggering Google's spam filters, so replacing them with real copy should help rankings. And the broken WordPress shortcode on the wholesale page was just embarrassing.
